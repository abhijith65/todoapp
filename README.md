# todo_app

A basic To-Do app typically allows users to:

Add tasks to a list.
Mark tasks as completed or delete tasks and sort by levels.
Display the list of tasks in a scrollable view.
Persist data (so the list of tasks remains available after the app is closed).

Each time a new task is created whole list is refreshed and have sort again.
